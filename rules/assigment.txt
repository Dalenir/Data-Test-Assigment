You need to develop a report generation service and a client script that will send data to this service.

Report Generation Service:

Receives a report generation task via RabbitMQ (the task includes a list of 10 phone numbers, as shown in sample_input.json).

Aggregates data based on the phone number (the "phone" field) and returns a response to the client in JSON format, including:

The total number of rows.
The number of rows categorized by duration (up to 10 seconds, 10 to 30 seconds, over 30 seconds).
The cost of the most expensive attempt (cost = duration * 10).
The cost of the least expensive attempt (cost = duration * 10).
The average duration.
The sum of costs for attempts with a duration exceeding 15 seconds.
The service can receive multiple such tasks from clients simultaneously and should return responses asynchronously.

The response should include the total duration of each report (total_duration).

Example response to the client is provided in the attachment sample_output.json.

Note:

The data for phone numbers is in JSON format with keys: "phone," "start_date," and "end_date." Phone numbers range from 1 to 200. "start_date" represents the call start time, and "end_date" represents the call end time.
High performance is crucial for this task. The service should be able to handle 10 simultaneous tasks from the client, each with 10 phone numbers.
You should publish this task on GitHub, and the service should be accompanied by a Dockerfile.
